Water skiing is a surface water sport in which an individual is pulled behind a
 boat or a cable ski installation over a body of water,
 skimming the surface on two skis or one ski. 
The sport requires sufficient area on a smooth stretch of water, 
one or two skis, a tow boat with tow rope, three people (depending on state boating laws), and a personal flotation device. In addition,
 the skier must have adequate upper and lower body strength, muscular endurance, and good balance.
 Skiing is a fun pastime that allows people of all skill levels and ages to enjoy. 
There is no minimum age necessary to water ski.
