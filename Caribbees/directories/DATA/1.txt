Champagne Reef –Named for the bubbles rising up through the sand from underwater hot springs, this site is accessible from shore and also good for snorkeling. Currents here are usually light and you may see seahorses, frogfish, flying gurnards, and squid.
Soufriere Pinnacles – This site consists of a series of deep-water pinnacles that drop off into the deep blue. The walls are covered in plate and whip corals with an amazing array of colorful sponges. Look up every now and then for turtles and mantas that occasionally swim by.
Point Break – Located where the Caribbean and the Atlantic meet on the northern tip of the island, Point Break offers a chance to see lots of large fish. There’s usually a decent current at the sight, but the wall and scenery are worth the effort. Be sure to check out the swim-throughs.
Cottage Point – Links of chain and other remnants of an 18th century wreck are scattered in shallow water. After surveying the wreck, swim around the pinnacles that are covered with color and full of invertebrate life.
Whale Shark Reef  – This reef starts at about 18 metres/60 feet and drops off to more than 40 metres/130 feet. Along the nice vertical face, large barrel sponges and tube sponges are abundant and colorful corals swarm with reef fish. There’s a chance to see barracudas, Spanish mackerel and jacks swimming off the reef.
Five Finger Rock – The site is named for rocks that looks like a hand and knuckles sticking out in the water. Look for colorful elephant ear sponges and spotted eagle rays swimming in the mild current.
